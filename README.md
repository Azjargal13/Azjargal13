# Hello 👋

I am Azjargal Gankhuyag (Azaa), a strategic thinker, and tech-driven problem solver who helps companies and businesses grow digitally. Expansion is what I seek in my day-to-day life. 

Currently based in the APAC region (Mongolia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and so on...) 


## 🚀 What I Do
With a background in software engineering and experience living, and traveling in 15+ countries, I bring up original, diverse solutions as a powerful system for change. I founded ByteCode Digital Marketing to help sustainability-focused brands and purpose-driven startups grow with smart, data-driven strategies. Our agency is APAC's first and only remote-serving agency whose sole goal is to serve impact-driven brands.   

## I believe that
- 🌱 Sustainable brands deserve visibility—not just in rankings, but in people’s minds.
- 📊 Marketing should be precise, not random—backed by data, AI, and strategy.
- 🤝 Authentic connections drive real impact—it’s about trust, not just transactions.

- Strategic Growth & AI-Driven Marketing: Helping brands scale with AI-powered storytelling, SEO, and analytics.
